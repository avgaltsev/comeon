# Comeon

Experimental CommonJS module loader for browsers.

This solution loads CommonJS specification modules to browser without modifying their source code by preprocessors at server side or evaluating in browser. Modules have been loaded and run as is.

## Usage

Link comeon.js to the page with `data-path` and `data-main` attributes that define where your modules are placed and which of them is the main respectively:

	<script src="http://rawgithub.com/avgaltsev/comeon/master/comeon.js" data-path="scripts/" data-main="main"></script>

Or do it without magic:

	<script src="http://rawgithub.com/avgaltsev/comeon/master/comeon.js"></script>
	
	<script>
		
		window.onload = function () {
			
			// Each instance of Comeon has its own path configuration and module cache
			var comeon = new Comeon("scripts/");
			
			// Entry point
			comeon.require("main");
			
			// Another entry point with callback function
			comeon.require("another_main", function (exports) {
				console.log(exports);
			});
			
		};
		
	</script>
